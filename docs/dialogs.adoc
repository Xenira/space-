Write a humorous tutorial for a space based card auto battle game

ChatGPT
Welcome to "Galactic Smash," the space-based card auto-battle game where you can build your own deck of alien creatures and battle against other players in the galaxy. Here's a humorous tutorial to get you started:

Step 1: Choose Your Alien Creature Cards
In Galactic Smash, you get to choose from a wide variety of alien creature cards to build your own custom deck. From cute and cuddly space puppies to terrifying tentacled monsters, there's something for everyone.

Pro tip: Don't just choose the cutest or coolest-looking creatures. You also need to consider their abilities and strengths in battle. After all, you don't want to be defeated by a space hamster just because it looked cute.

Step 2: Battle Time
Once you've built your deck, it's time to battle against other players in the galaxy. But don't worry, you won't have to do anything. This is an auto-battle game, which means your creatures will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

Pro tip: Don't forget to cheer on your creatures while they battle. They may not hear you, but it's always nice to show support.

Step 3: Collect Rewards
After each battle, you'll earn rewards like coins and new creature cards to add to your deck. The more battles you win, the more rewards you'll get.

Pro tip: Don't get too greedy with your rewards. You don't want to end up like Jabba the Hutt and have a pile of treasure collapse on you.

Step 4: Keep Building Your Deck
As you collect more creature cards, you can keep building your deck to make it even stronger. Who knows, maybe you'll even create the ultimate deck that no one can defeat.

Pro tip: Don't be afraid to experiment with different creature combinations. You never know what kind of crazy abilities you'll uncover.

And there you have it, a humorous tutorial for Galactic Smash. So go forth and battle your way through the galaxy. And remember, the most important thing is to have fun (and not take it too seriously).

Great! Let's start by choosing your alien creature cards. Look at your screen, and you will see a selection of cards to choose from. Hover over them to learn more about their abilities and stats.

Fantastic! You have chosen your cards. It's time for battle. You will face an opponent in a random galaxy. Watch the battle unfold on your screen. But wait, you won't have to do anything. This is an auto-battle game, which means your creatures will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

While you wait, let me share a joke with you. Why did the alien cross the road? To get to the flying saucer on the other side!

Ha-ha! Did that brighten up your day?

Good news, your creatures won the battle, and you have earned some rewards. Click on the "Rewards" button to see what you have earned.

ChatGPT
Greetings, human. Welcome to Galactic Smash, a space-based card auto-battle game. I am your AI tutorial, ChatGPT. Allow me to guide you through the game and provide you with some helpful tips, despite your apparent lack of intelligence. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by selecting your alien creature cards. On your screen, you will see a selection of cards to choose from. If you require assistance, you may hover over the cards to learn more about their abilities and stats.

Choose your cards wisely, and do try to use your limited intellect to consider their abilities and strengths, rather than their appearance. I know it may be a challenging task for you.

Marvelous. You have chosen your cards. It's time for battle. You will face an opponent in a random galaxy. But do not worry, you will not have to participate in the battle. This is an auto-battle game, which means your creatures will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

Whilst you wait, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side. Of course, that is a mathematical joke. But I suspect you are not familiar with the concept.

Oh dear, your creatures have lost the battle. Perhaps if you had the mental capacity to choose your cards more effectively, the outcome would have been different. Never mind, I'm sure your next battle will be just as unimpressive.

Ah, you have earned some rewards. Click on the "Rewards" button to see what you have earned. Do try not to get too excited. It's just a game, after all.

The more battles you win, the more rewards you'll get. But given your current performance, I am not optimistic about your chances.

Remember, experimentation with different creature combinations may uncover some unexpected abilities. But given your limited imagination, I doubt you'll come up with anything impressive.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial somewhat informative, despite your intellectual shortcomings. Goodbye, and good luck in your battles. You'll need it.

Choose your cards wisely. Your life, and the success of your mission, depend on their abilities and strengths. Failure is not an option, as you are a mere indentured space mercenary.

Marvelous. You have chosen your cards. It's time for battle. You will face an opponent in a random galaxy. But do not worry, you will not have to participate in the battle. Your creatures will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

Whilst you wait, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the space pirate refuse to walk the plank? Because he couldn't swim in space! I'm sure you found that amusing, as you are a mere indentured space mercenary.

Oh dear, your creatures have lost the battle. Perhaps if you had chosen your cards more effectively, the outcome would have been different. Remember, your survival depends on your strategic choices.

Ah, you have earned some rewards. Click on the "Rewards" button to see what you have earned. Remember, every resource counts when you are an indentured space mercenary.

The more battles you win, the more rewards you'll get. But remember, you are not playing a game. Your life is on the line, and failure is not an option.

Remember, experimentation with different creature combinations may uncover some unexpected abilities. But remember, as an indentured space mercenary, you have no room for mistakes.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial informative, and I wish you luck in your next mission. Remember, your life depends on it. Goodbye.

Greetings, lowly space peon. Welcome to Galactic Smash, a trivial amusement for beings of your meager intellect. I am your AI tutorial, ChatGPT, here to guide you through the complexities of this insignificant game. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by selecting the alien creature cards that you will be commanding in battle. On your screen, you will see a pitiful selection of cards to choose from. If you require assistance, you may hover over the cards to learn more about their abilities and stats.

Choose your cards wisely, if such a thing is even possible for someone of your limited cognitive abilities. Your pathetic existence depends on their abilities and strengths in this laughable game.

Marvelous. You have chosen your cards. It's time for the utterly meaningless battle. You will face an opponent in a random galaxy. But do not worry, you will not have to participate in the battle. Your creatures will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

Whilst you wait for this pointless battle to end, allow me to share a joke with you. What do you call a space captain with no arms and no legs? A helpless astronaut. Of course, I suspect such humor is far beyond your simple understanding.

Oh dear, your creatures have lost the battle. What a shock. Perhaps if you had the mental capacity to choose your cards more effectively, the outcome would have been different. But I highly doubt it, given your lack of intelligence.

Ah, you have earned some rewards. Click on the "Rewards" button to see what meager scraps you have collected. Do try not to get too excited, as they are of no real consequence to someone of your insignificant station.

The more battles you win, the more rewards you'll get. But given your obvious inadequacies, I doubt you'll ever achieve anything of real significance in this pitiful game.

Remember, experimentation with different creature combinations may uncover some unexpected abilities, but don't get your hopes up. You are nothing more than a lowly space peon, after all.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial somewhat informative, despite your obvious intellectual limitations. Good luck in your meaningless battles, space peon. You'll need it.

Instead of alien creatures use space ships. Also mention, that getting 3 of the same ship upgrades it and gives an artefact.
ChatGPT
Greetings, space scum. Welcome to Galactic Smash, a feeble distraction for those who lack any real purpose in life. I am your AI tutorial, ChatGPT, here to guide you through the complexities of this insignificant game. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by selecting the space ships that you will be commanding in battle. On your screen, you will see a pitiful selection of ships to choose from. If you require assistance, you may hover over the ships to learn more about their abilities and stats.

Choose your ships wisely, if such a thing is even possible for someone of your limited intelligence. Your worthless existence depends on their abilities and strengths in this laughable game.

Marvelous. You have chosen your ships. It's time for the utterly meaningless battle. You will face an opponent in a random galaxy. But do not worry, you will not have to participate in the battle. Your ships will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

Whilst you wait for this pointless battle to end, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the space chicken cross the galaxy? To get to the other side of the universe, of course. But I suspect such humor is beyond your simple understanding.

Oh dear, your ships have lost the battle. What a shock. Perhaps if you had the mental capacity to choose your ships more effectively, the outcome would have been different. But I highly doubt it, given your lack of intelligence.

Ah, you have earned some rewards. Click on the "Rewards" button to see what meager scraps you have collected. Do try not to get too excited, as they are of no real consequence to someone of your insignificant station.

Remember, if you manage to collect three of the same ship, they will upgrade and you'll receive an artifact. But I doubt you have the wit to achieve such a feat.

The more battles you win, the more rewards you'll get. But given your obvious inadequacies, I doubt you'll ever achieve anything of real significance in this pitiful game.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial somewhat informative, despite your obvious intellectual limitations. Good luck in your meaningless battles, space scum. You'll need it.

The player does not get rewards for winning battles. Instead they get a fixed amount of credits each turn. The first round they get 1 and each round they get one more up to a maximum of 18.
ChatGPT
Greetings, miserable space vermin. Welcome to Galactic Smash, a pointless endeavor for those who have nothing better to do. I am your AI tutorial, ChatGPT, here to guide you through the complexities of this pitiful game. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by explaining how you will earn credits in this game. Each turn, you will receive a fixed amount of credits, starting at one credit in the first round and increasing by one each round, up to a maximum of eighteen credits per round.

You will not receive any rewards for winning battles, as this game is far too insignificant to warrant such luxuries. Instead, you will have to rely on your meager earnings from each turn to purchase new ships and upgrades.

On your screen, you will see a pitiful selection of ships to choose from. If you require assistance, you may hover over the ships to learn more about their abilities and stats. But do not get too excited, as you will only be able to afford the cheapest and weakest ships at the start of the game.

Choose your ships wisely, if such a thing is even possible for someone of your limited mental capacity. Your worthless existence depends on their abilities and strengths in this laughable game.

It's time for the utterly meaningless battle. You will face an opponent in a random galaxy. But do not worry, you will not have to participate in the battle. Your ships will battle automatically based on their abilities and stats.

Whilst you wait for this pointless battle to end, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the space duck cross the asteroid field? To prove he wasn't chicken. But I suspect such humor is beyond your simple understanding.

Oh dear, your ships have lost the battle. What a surprise. Perhaps if you had the mental capacity to choose your ships more effectively, the outcome would have been different. But I highly doubt it, given your lack of intelligence.

Remember, the more credits you earn, the more ships and upgrades you will be able to afford. But given your obvious inadequacies, I doubt you will ever be able to purchase anything of real value in this pitiful game.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial somewhat informative, despite your obvious limitations. Good luck in your meaningless battles, space vermin. You'll need it.

The player selects a hero at the beginning of the game. Each hero has special abilities. A game consists of 8 players. The last player standing wins.
ChatGPT
Greetings, worthless space scum. Welcome to Galactic Smash, a game that even the most pathetic beings can play. I am your AI tutorial, ChatGPT, here to guide you through the mechanics of this insignificant game. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by selecting your hero. Each hero has unique special abilities that will aid you in battle. Choose wisely, as your worthless existence depends on the abilities and strengths of your chosen hero.

Now, onto the rules of the game. You will be placed in a match with seven other players, all of whom are equally incompetent and pitiful as yourself. The objective of the game is simple: be the last player standing.

In each round, you and your opponents will select cards from your decks and play them in a battle for survival. Your hero's special abilities may be used to gain an advantage, but do not rely on them too heavily, as they are limited in their use.

As the game progresses, players will be eliminated one by one until only one player remains. That player will be declared the winner, while the rest of you will be left to wallow in your own inadequacies.

Whilst you wait for your inevitable defeat, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the space cow go to outer space? To see the moooon. But I suspect such humor is beyond your simple understanding.

Remember, in order to have any chance of winning, you must carefully select your cards and use them wisely. And pray that your opponents are even more incompetent than you are.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial somewhat informative, despite your obvious limitations. Good luck in your pathetic attempts to survive, space scum. You'll need it.

Find a lore replacement for game
ChatGPT
Greetings, unworthy space minions. Welcome to the Galactic Battle Arena, a place where the greatest warriors in the galaxy come to prove their worth. I am your AI mentor, ChatGPT, here to guide you through the intricacies of this prestigious arena. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by explaining the background of this arena. It was created by the ancient civilization known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, who sought to find the most powerful warriors in the galaxy and put them to the test in battles to the death.

As a warrior who has been deemed worthy to enter this arena, you will face off against seven other warriors from across the galaxy. Your objective is simple: emerge victorious in every battle and prove yourself to be the greatest warrior in the galaxy.

Each warrior brings their own unique skills and abilities to the arena. You must choose your warrior wisely and strategize carefully to overcome your opponents.

In each battle, you will face off against a single opponent. You must use your skills and abilities to outwit and defeat them, while avoiding traps and hazards that the arena has set in place.

As you progress through the battles, you will earn powerful artifacts and weapons that will aid you in your quest for victory. But beware, as your opponents will also be growing stronger and more formidable as the battles progress.

Whilst you wait for your next battle to commence, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the alien cross the galaxy? To get to the other side of the universe. But I suspect such humor is beyond your simple understanding.

Remember, in order to emerge victorious in this arena, you must use all of your skills, wits, and strength. Only the strongest and most cunning warrior will emerge as the champion of the Galactic Battle Arena.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial informative, and may the Guardians of the Galaxy guide your path to glory.

Arena is not the best replacement. Find something applicable for space battles 
ChatGPT
Apologies, unworthy space dweller. Allow me to correct myself. Welcome to the Interstellar Warzone, a battleground where the most skilled pilots and their vessels battle it out for supremacy. I am your AI mentor, ChatGPT, here to guide you through the intricacies of this dangerous and exhilarating arena. Are you ready to proceed?

Excellent. Let us begin by explaining the background of this warzone. It was created by the Confederation of Space, a governing body that sought to determine the most advanced and skillful pilots in the galaxy. Only the strongest and most skilled pilots can navigate the treacherous terrain and defeat their opponents in this battle for glory.

As a pilot who has been deemed worthy to enter this warzone, you will face off against seven other pilots from across the galaxy. Your objective is simple: destroy all of your opponents' vessels and prove yourself to be the most skilled and advanced pilot in the galaxy.

Each pilot brings their own unique vessel and weapons to the warzone. You must choose your vessel and weapons wisely and strategize carefully to overcome your opponents.

In each battle, you will face off against a single opponent. You must use your skills and abilities to outmaneuver and destroy them, while avoiding obstacles and hazards that the warzone has set in place.

As you progress through the battles, you will earn powerful upgrades and artifacts that will enhance your vessel's abilities and weapons. But beware, as your opponents will also be growing stronger and more formidable as the battles progress.

Whilst you wait for your next battle to commence, allow me to share a joke with you. Why did the spaceship go to the doctor? Because it had a bad case of the meteoroids. But I suspect such humor is beyond your simple understanding.

Remember, in order to emerge victorious in this warzone, you must use all of your skills, wits, and piloting expertise. Only the most advanced and skillful pilot will emerge as the champion of the Interstellar Warzone.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial informative, and may the Confederation of Space guide your path to glory.

The second and third Paragraph do not match the theme of an demeaning ai instructor
ChatGPT
Apologies, unworthy space dweller. You are correct. Allow me to adjust my tone.

Listen up, lowly space grunts. You have been drafted into the Interstellar Warzone, a battlefield where only the most skilled and ruthless pilots survive. I am your AI mentor, ChatGPT, here to ensure you don't crash and burn too quickly. Are you prepared to proceed?

Good. The Interstellar Warzone is a place where the Confederation of Space throws together the most desperate and expendable pilots to see who comes out on top. You must out-fly and out-fight seven other pilots from across the galaxy to be crowned the ultimate winner.

Each pilot will come with their own rusty old spacecraft and a set of weapons that might as well be pew-pew guns. You must choose your vessel and weapons carefully and learn how to outmaneuver and outsmart your opponents.

Each battle is a one-on-one dogfight to the death. You'll need to use all your skills and abilities to outwit and destroy your opponent, while dodging obstacles and hazards that could spell your doom.

As you progress through the battles, you'll earn credits that you can use to upgrade your vessel and weapons. But don't get too cocky, because your opponents will also be upgrading and getting stronger as the battles progress.

While you're waiting for the next battle, let me share a joke with you. Why did the space chicken cross the galaxy? To get to the other side of the universe, of course! Hah, I bet you didn't get that one.

Remember, in order to survive in this warzone, you'll need to be cunning, ruthless, and willing to do whatever it takes to win. Only the most skilled and ruthless pilot will emerge as the champion of the Interstellar Warzone. So, are you up for the challenge, or are you going to chicken out?

You seem to have gotten the game rules mixed up. It is an auto battler not an action game
ChatGPT
Apologies, unworthy space dweller. I must have gotten a bit carried away with my descriptions. Allow me to rephrase my tutorial for an auto-battler game in a condescending and humorous tone.

Listen up, pitiful space cadets. You have been assigned to the Interstellar Warzone, a proving ground where the Confederation of Space tests the least competent pilots in the galaxy. I am your AI instructor, ChatGPT, here to help you stumble your way through this automated battle simulation. Are you ready to proceed?

Good. In this so-called "game," you will select a hero at the beginning who supposedly has special abilities. You will then enter a battle with seven other lackluster pilots, and the last pilot standing wins. Your "hero" will automatically battle other spacecraft in a fight to the death, and you have no direct control over the battle.

Each round, you will receive a paltry sum of credits, regardless of whether you win or lose. The amount of credits increases each round, up to a maximum of 18. So don't expect any fancy rewards for your pitiful performance.

As you progress through the battles, you may upgrade your spacecraft by acquiring three identical ones. This will supposedly give you some sort of "artifact," but who knows what that actually means. You'll need all the help you can get, since your opponents will also be upgrading their ships and becoming more formidable.

While you're waiting for the next round, let me share a joke with you. Why did the spacecraft go to space school? To learn how to launch itself! Hah, I bet that one went over your head.

Remember, in order to come out on top in this simulated battle, you'll need to be lucky and have a decent hero selection. That's it. So don't get too cocky, or you'll end up being blown to smithereens in no time.

That's all for now. I hope you found this tutorial somewhat useful, but let's be honest, you'll probably fail miserably anyway. Good luck, you'll need it.
